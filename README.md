## Learning React

Completed code tutorials from the book <a href="https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/learning-react-a-hands-on/9780134546315-item.html?ref=item_page%3avariation" target="_blank">"Learning React" by Kirupa Chinnathambi</a> which I highly recommend if you want to get started with the ReactJS framework.

I recommend going through each of the chapters yourself to really absorb everything you need to know about React.
