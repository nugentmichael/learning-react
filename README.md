## Learning React

Code examples from the book <a href="https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/learning-react-a-hands-on/9780134546315-item.html?ref=item_page%3avariation" target="_blank">"Learning React" by Kirupa Chinnathambi</a> which I highly recommend if you want to get started with the ReactJS framework.

Each chapter has been split up into its own separate branch, while all of the completed lessons are available under the master branch.

I recommend going through each of the chapters yourself to really absorb everything that you need to know about React.
